### How to stop manual testing SQL
When you are tasting anything that's data specific you have to breake it into two components
* testing your data
* testing your code

##### Testing the code
dbt exceeded the expectation compare to the antecedents

dbt allows to test the sql code
* Generic test (now it has another terminology) 
    * little flags you can add to the documentations(check not nulls, )(Great expectations )

##### Testing the data
* Singular tests
* unit tests


### DATA WAREHOUSE / DATA LAKE / LAKEHOUSE
* DATA WAREHOUSE 
    "Data warehouses are databases for analytics processes where the data is properly model and integrated and all the table should join with each other"
* DATA LAKE
    "dumping data directly for the systems, but nobody has takes the to integrate that data, there's not such thing as client table more like a client folder"
* LAKE HOUSE
    "data lakes with logical business representation on top that could be queried" 
    it's not quite a warehouses because there is not a formal table, just a bunch of JSONs or PARQUETs
